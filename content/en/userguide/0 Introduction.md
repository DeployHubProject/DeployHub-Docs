## Why Use DeployHub

DeployHub is a Continuous Security Intelligence solution designed for decoupled architectures. DeployHub  monitors and collects DevSecOps data from the CI/CD pipeline for every artifact. It unifies the data generated across your pipeline, offering a consolidated security profile of the software delivered to end users. With DeployHubâ€™s integrated security intelligence, you can quickly respond to vulnerabilities and issues, gaining a clear view of how a vulnerable package is used, which applications depend on it, and where it has been deployed.

DeployHub is based on the open-source Continuous Delivery Foundation project, [Ortelius.io](https://ortelius.io)

### Security Postures in Decoupled Environments

A crucial concept in decoupled architecture is the "<strong>logical</strong> _Application_." A logical _Application_ is a collection of independently deployed _Components_. Each _Component_ has its own Software Bill of Materials report, vulnerability status and security posture. In order to report the security posture of the entire solution delivered to end users, the _Component_ data must be aggregated to the _Application_ level. DeployHub manages logical _Application Versions_ within a decoupled architecture, offering a comprehensive view of the software's security posture. DeployHub provides logical _Application_ SBOMs, real-time _Application_ vulnerabilities, and compliance summaries, based on both the _Component_ and the aggregated logical _Application_. 

DeployHub surveils the DevSecOps pipeline to automatically gather security and DevOps data for all _Components_. DeployHub captures DevSecOps data when a _Component_ has been published, creating a new version for each release. It then creates new _Application Versions_ for all impacted 'logical' _Applications_.

## Versioning - DeployHub's Secret Sauce

DeployHub versions both _Components_ and 'logical' _Applications_.  When versioning _Components_, DeployHub provides insights into that versions security posture including:

- Software Bill of Material
- OpenSSF Scorecard 
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
- Swagger Details
- Readme and Licensing
- Consuming Applications
- Ownership
- Git repo
- Git Commit (Tag and branch)
- CI/CD Build Number
- Container SHA
- Docker Registry
- Key Values
- Deployment Script (Helm Chart, Ansible Playbook, etc.)
- Any Attributes (DB Name for example)

 _Application Versions_ are based on a collection of _Component Versions_. When a new version of a _Component_ is created, DeployHub auto increments the _Component_ version and all consuming _Application_ versions.  The dashboard shows for each _Application_ version:

- A full map of all _Components_ the _Application_ version is consuming
- An aggregated _Application_ SBOM
- An _Application_ CVE report, with real-time updates
- The specific changes that created the new _Application_ version (your new diff report)
- The audit history
- Log history
- Where the new _Component_ is running
- Trends (Deployment time, success failure rates)
- An _Application_ security posture report


## Core Features

**Package Vulnerability Search**

 Discover where a vulnerability is running across all endpoints. DeployHub shows which logical _Applications_ are consuming a vulnerable package, and where it is deployed. 

**Dependency maps:** 

Understand _Component_ to _Application_ dependencies. DeployHub presents the 'logical' view of an _Application_ with all _Components_ dependencies. 

**Application Level SBOMs and CVE:** 

DeployHub aggregates all _Component_ level data up to the logical _Application Version_ making it easy to provide security reporting on a complete software system, even when it is decoupled. DeployHub makes it easy to respond to government Software Bill of Material reporting as defined in Executive Order 14028. 

**Blast Radius:**

See how a single _Component_ impacts consuming _Applications_. DeployHub can provide predictive insights showing what _Applications_ will be impacted by an updated service. DeployHub provides this data in clear maps of dependent _Applications_ and services. The blast radius also shows what _Components_ and _Applications_ are impacted by a vulnerability for rapid response. 

**Improved incident response:**

 DeployHub makes it easy to find the owner of _Component_, and contact them through PagerDuty, HipChat, Discord, Slack, email or phone.

**Integrates into your CD pipeline:** 

DeployHub is automated via the CD Pipeline to continuously version your decoupled architecture with changes, including where they are deployed.

**Domain-Driven-Design:**

 The DeployHub Domain structure organizes the software supply chain to encourage reuse and sharing across development teams.

## DeployHub Team - Free Version

A free version of DeployHub is available and based upon the [Ortleius](https://www.Ortelius.io/) open source project. DeployHub Team can be used from the hosted site or installed on premise. It is a strategic and fully open source continuous security intelligence system that integrates with your DevOps tools. It supports unlimited endpoints, versions, and users. [Learn more](/userguide/0-ortelius-tutorial/). 

## DeployHub Pro

For additional security features and support, DeployHub Pro includes extended Users and Group access controls as well as more granular _Domains_.

Unique to DeployHub Pro are "Divisional Domains." These _Domains_ allow you to expand and model your environments based on your organizational top-down structure. It also gives you the ability to restrict read/write access to only certain Groups of Users.


### DeployHub Pro's Agentless Delivery

If you do not have a centralized solution for automating deployments, DeployHub can help. DeployHub Pro includes a deployment engine for pushing _Components_ to your _Endpoints_ (Clusters, Cloud, etc.) using an agentless architecture. The deployment engine can support containers and any type of file object including executables, jar files, Apex files, and Lamda functions.

This agentless technology works for both cloud native and legacy architectures including:

- AWS, Google Compute, Azure
- Cloud Foundry
- Kubernetes, Docker
- SalesForce
- Windows 2008, Windows 2012
- Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, Linux
- Microsoft Azure
- Ubantu, Redhat, SuSe, Debina
- Tandem, Stratus, IBM iSeries, OpenVMS, Unisys, IBM 4690
- z/OS
- Jetty, Tomcat, WebSphere
- Microsoft IIS, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle
- Request Routers and Appliances
