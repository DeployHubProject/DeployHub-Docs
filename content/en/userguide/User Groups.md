    Add additional User Groups for more security and control over DeployHub Objects.

## Intro to _Groups_

Access control to Objects are based on _Groups_. DeployHub allows you to create custom _Groups_ for organizing _Users_ giving you more granular security control around the DeployHub Objects.

DeployHub default _Groups_ include:
-Administrator _Group_ - The _User_ who initially signs into DeployHub is automatically added to this _Group_. By default, this _Group_ has access to all objects.
-User _Group_ - All _Users_ who sign in after the initial Administrator _User_ is created.
-Everyone _Group_ - All Users regardless of their assigned _Group_ are automatically added to this _Group_. It is the default _Group_ that provides access to "everyone" for all Objects.  To restrict _Everyone_ access, update the _Access_ options at the Object level.  This _Group_ cannot be modified.  If you delete a _User_ from the system, they will be deleted from the Everyone _Group_.

[_Users_](/userguide/advanced-features/2-users/) are given access to DeployHub Objects based on their _Group_ access. A many-to-many relationship exists between _Users_ and _Groups_, so that a _User_ can belong to many different _Groups_, and a _Group_ can contain many different _Users_. If a _User_ belongs to more than one _Group_, the _User_ will be given the highest level of access.

## _Groups_ and _Domain_ Inheritance

_Users_ and _Groups_ are created under a _Domain_. A _User_ or _Group_ that is created at a higher level _Domain_ will inherit access to all _Sub-Domains_, based on their access settings. _Group_ access and inherited access properties can be overridden within a _Sub-Domain_. As an example, Administrators, Director, and Operational level _Users_ or _Groups_ can be assigned to the highest level _Domain_ for the Enterprise while Application Teams and Testing Teams can be defined to only the _Sub-Domains_ that pertain to their area of expertise. _Users_ or _Groups_ can belong to multiple _Domains_.  

## Using the _Group_ List View for Adding or Deleting

You will find _Groups_ under the Setup menu.  Selecting _Groups_ will take you to a list of all _Groups_ which you have access to. You can also use the Filter bar, represented by a funnel icon, to reorder your _Groups_ List View based on _Groups_ and _Domains_.

The _Groups_ List View has the following Tabs.

| Tab         | Description                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Refresh** | Refreshes the browser.                               |
| **Add**     | Allows you to Add a new _User_ of a particular type. |
| **Delete**  | Deletes the selected item.                           |

From the _Groups_ List View, double click on the _Group_ which you would like to view to see all Details.  

## Using the _Group_ Dashboard for Viewing and Editing

The _Group_ Dashboard view displays all information related to a specific _Group_.

### User Membership

NOTE: DeployHub creates a Group named "Everyone" whenever it is installed, and every User that is created is added to this group and cannot be removed from it.

This section shows a list of all _Users_ who belong to the selected _Group_. Click on the plus '+Add' option to add a _User_ to this _Group_. A new row will be added to the table with a drop down list allowing you to select the _User_ to add to the _Group_. Select "Save" to commit the row to the table. You can use the Edit option to make a switch without having to first perform a Delete, and then an +Add.
