  Using _Notifiers_ for communicating deployment results.
---

## Intro to _Notifiers_

 _Notifiers_ send messages to various recipients and can be used as follows:

- After a successful or failed deployment.
- When a _Request_ Task has ben used against an _Application_.
- When an _Endpoint_ is unavailable.
- Used As part of your continuous _Delivery Pipeline_ to automatically update users.

DeployHub Pro can use Email, Slack, SMS, and HipChat for this purpose.

## _Notifiers_ and _Notifier Templates_

_Notifiers_ are associated to a _Notifier Template_. The _Notifier Template_ is used for sending standard message for your _Notifier_. A _Notifier_ contains one or more _Notifier Templates_. See [Using _Notifier Templates_](/userguide/advanced-features/deployments/2-notifier-templates/) for more information.

Using these two objects, _Notifiers_ and _Notifier Templates_, notifications can be sent whenever a deployment to an _Environment_ fails or succeeds, whenever a _Request_ Task is executed, or the state of an _EndPoint_ changes. A a variety of email or messaging systems can be used to individually tailor notifications containing all information needed to inform all relevant teams.

## Using the _Notifiers_ List View for Adding or Deleting

You will find _Notifiers_ under the Advanced Features menu.  Selecting _Notifiers_ will take you to a list of all _Notifiers_ to which you have access. You can also use the Filter bar, represented by a funnel icon, to reorder your _Notifiers_ List View.  You can reorder the list view on _Notifiers_ and _Domains_

_Notifiers_ are defined to a _Domain_ and will be displayed based on your access to the _Domain_ to which it belongs.

The _Notifiers_ List View has the following Tabs.

| Tab     | Description                                              |

| Add     | Allows you to Add a new _Notifier_ of a particular type. |
| Delete  | Deletes the selected item.                               |

From the _Notifier_ List View, double click on the _Notifier_ which you would like to view to see all Details.

The Dashboard view displays all information related to a specific _Notifier_.

## Notifier Access Controls

The Access Section allows _Users_ within designated _Groups_ to update the _Notifier_ in various ways. To add a _Group_ to one of the access lists, drag and drop the _Group_ from the Available Groups list onto desired access list. All _Users_ who belong to a _Group_ that appear in one of the Access lists will be granted access to the _Notifier_ in the following ways:

| Access     | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **View**   | Allows _Users_ to see the _Notifier_. If the _User_ does not belong to a _Group_ in the View Access list, the _Notifier_ will not appear in the List View. |
| **Change** | This allows a _User_ who belongs to any _UserGroup_ in the list to change the attributes of the _Notifier_.                                                |
| **Send**   | Allows _Users_ to send an email.                                                                                                                           |
