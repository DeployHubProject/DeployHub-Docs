## Intro to Data Sources

_Data Sources_ are used to connect to Jira, Bugzilla, and GitHub to track change request and LDAP and Active Directory for single sign-on. You will need to define a _Credential_ for these _Data Sources_ in order to login. See [Create Your Credentials](/userguide/advanced-features/deployments/2-define-your-credentials/) for more information on defining a _Credential_ for your _Data Source_.

## The _Data Sources_ List View for Adding or Deleting

You will find _Data Sources_ under the Setup menu.  Selecting _Data Sources_ will take you to a list of all _DataSources_ which you have access to. You can also use the Filter bar, represented by a funnel icon, to reorder your _Data Sources_ List View.  You can filter the list view on _Data Sources_ and _Domains_. _Data Sources_ are defined to a _Domain_ and will be displayed based on your access to the _Domain_.

The _Data Sources_ List View has the following Tabs.

| Tab     | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Refresh | Refreshes the browser.                                                                                                                                             |
| Add     | Allows you to Add a new _Data Sources_ of the following types: <ul><li>Jira</li><li>Bugzilla</li><li>GitHub Issues</li><li>LDAP</li><li>Active Directory</li></ul> |
| Delete  | Deletes the selected item.                                                                                                                                         |

From the _Data Source_ List View, double click on the _Data Source_ which you would like to view to see all Details.  

## Using the _Data Sources_ Dashboard for Viewing and Editing

The Dashboard view displays all information related to a specific _Data Source_.

## _Data Source_ Access Controls

The Access Section allows _Users_ within designated _Groups_ to update the _Data Source_ in various ways. To add a _Group_ to one of the access lists, drag and drop the _Group_ from the Available Groups list onto desired access list. All _Users_ who belong to a _Group_ that appear in one of the Access lists will be granted access to the _Data Source_ in the following ways:

| Access     | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **View**   | Allows _Users_ to see the _Data Source_. If the _User_ does not belong to a _Group_ in the View Access list, the _Data Source_ will not appear in the List View. |
| **Change** | This allows a _User_ who belongs to any _User_ _Group_ in the list to change the attributes of the _Data Source_.                                                |
| **Select** | Allows _Users_ to use the _Data Source_ to access external data.                                                                                                 |
| **Delete** | Allows the _User_ to remove the _Data Source_.                                                                                                                   |

NOTE: **DeployHub Team** has only two Groups, _Administrators_ and _Users_. If you need more granularity in your UserGroups, you will need to upgrade to **DeployHub Pro.**
