  Working with Objects using DMScript.
---

## DMScript

_DMScript_ is an object-orientated scripting language. As such, it understands each object in the DeployHub Pro model. You can access each object either by selecting it off the stack (e.g.: $_Environment_), by retrieving a reference to the object from some other object, or by calling a built-in _Function_ to retrieve it. Each object has accessible properties. Some objects also have methods that can be called.

The following is a list of the objects that you can reference in _DMScript_.

- Application
- Change Request
- Components
- Component Items
- Credentials
- Date
- Domain
- DropZone
- DropZone File
- Environment
- Endpoint
- User
- UserGroup

### Attributes

Attributes set against DeployHub Pro objects are accessible as variables in _DMScript_.

For example, suppose QUEUE\_NAME is queue1 in "Test _Environment_ A" and queue2 in "Test _Environment_ B". When deploying to "Test _Environment_ A" the value of $QUEUE\_NAME will be queue1. When deploying to "Test _Environment_ B" the value of $QUEUE\_NAME will be queue2.

You do not need to use any specific syntax to access an Object variable. Whenever a variable is accessed, _DMScript_ will navigate up the _Stack_, looking for the first scope in which the variable is declared. When a variable with a matching name is found, the value at that point is returned. This means that variable values can be overwritten with other values declared higher in the stack. See the high-level section named The Stack for further discussion on this.

### Application Object

The _Application_ object represents either a Base _Application_, an _Application Version,_ or a Release. In DeployHub Pro there is always an _Application_ on the stack representing the _Application_/_Release_ being deployed referenced by $_Application_. You can also retrieve an _Application_ using the get_Application__Function_ or push an _Application_ onto the Stack via using _Application_.

NOTE: A _Release_ is a DeployHub Pro Object. It is of the _type__Application_. The release property indicates if the object represents a Release.

The following properties can be accessed for an _Application_ object:

| **Property**   | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                            |

| ctime          | Date     | Date Object representing the date/time the _Application_ was created.                                                                                      |
| mtime          | Date     | Date Object representing the date/time the _Application_ was last modified.                                                                                |

|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| children(all)        | Array           | Returns an array of _Application_ objects representing the descendants of this _Application_. If the parameter _all_ is passed as true then the returned array includes all the descendants of the immediate descendants recursively. If the parameter _all_ is omitted or passed as false then the return array only includes the immedate descendants.                                                                                                                                                     |
| versions(all)        | Array           | Synonym for children. Works identically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| getatt(attname)      | String          | Returns the value of the specified attribute held against the _Application_. Parameter is the attribute name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| requests(onlyForApp) | Array           | Returns an Array of _Change Request_ objects. If onlyForApp is not specified or passed as false then this is identical to accessing the requests attribute. If onlyForApp is specfied as true then only the change request records associated with the _Application_ itself are returned Note: No change request which is only associated with a consituent _Component_ is returned. This allows you to differentiate between change requests associated with the _Application_ and any of its _Components_. |
| latest(branchname)   | Object          | Returns the latest _Application Version_ of this _Application_. If branchname is specified then the returned _Application_ Object is the latest version on the specified branch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Attributes such as _owner_ and _parent_ return _Objects_. These objects have their own attributes. So, for example, one can get the owner name of an _Application_ by writing:

```bash

set owner = ${_Application_.owner};

echo ${owner.name};

or, more simply:

echo ${_Application_.owner.name};

Get _Application_ Approval Status:

set approvals = ${_Application_.approvals};

foreach(a: $approvals) {

echo "$a : ${approvals[$a]}";

}

// e.g.:

// Test : approved

// Prod : rejected
```

Since the array is keyed on the domain name, you can easily check if the app is approved for a particular domain:

```bash
set approvals = ${_Application_.approvals};

if (${approvals["Test"]} = "approved") {

// _Application_ is approved for Test Domain

}
```

Or you can use dot notation (assuming the target domain name does not contain spaces):

```bash
set approvals = ${_Application_.approvals};

if (${approvals.Test} = "approved") {

// _Application_ is approved for Test Domain

}
```

To iterate through the _Component_s that make up the_Application_:

```bash
set Components = ${Application.Components};

echo "This Application has ${Components.length()} Components";

iterate(c: $Components) {

echo "Component ${c.name} (id ${c.id})";

}
```

### Change Request Object

The _Change Request_ object represents a change request record associated with either a _Component_ or an _Application_. Arrays of _Change Request_ objects are returned by accessing the requests property of an _Application_ or _Component_ object or the requests() method of an _Application_.

The following properties can be accessed for a _Change Request_ object:

| ID        | String | The change request id.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name      | String | The change request description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| status    | String | The change request status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| API\_url  | String | A URL which - if passed to restful\_get - will return an array containing the full details of the change request from the external change tracking system. Useful for getting more information than the ID / description / status combination which is stored in DeployHub Pro. |
| html\_url | String | A URL which will direct a browser to the page describing the change request in the external change tracking system.                                                                                                                                                         |

### Component Object

The _Component_ object represents either a _Base Component_ or a _Component_ Version. When deploying an _Application_, _Components_ are pushed onto the stack after each _Endpoint_. They can also be pushed onto the stack by using a comploop, retrieved from an _Application_ by using ${_Application_._Components_} or retrieved by calling _get_Component_.

The following properties can be accessed for a _Component_ object:

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                        |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ID           | Integer  | _Component_ id, as used in the database.                                                               |
| name         | String   | _Component_ name.                                                                                      |

| summary      | String   | Summary text.                                                                                          |
| domain       | Object   | Domain in which the _Component_ is contained.                                                          |
| owner        | Object   | User or UserGroup that owns the _Component._                                                           |
| parent       | Object   | The Base _Component._                                                                                  |
| predecessor  | Object   | Predecessor _Component_ Version (the version on which this version is based).                          |
| items        | Array    | An array of _Component_ Item objects. These represent the items that make up this _Component_.         |
| servers      | Array    | An array of _Endpoint_ objects. These are the _Endpoints_ to which this _Component_ has been deployed. |
| requests     | Array    | Array of _Change Request_ objects – the change requests associated with this _Component_.              |
| lastbuild    | Integer  | The last build number for this _Component_. 0 if never built.                                          |

| mtime        | Date     | Date Object representing the date/time the _Component_ was last modified.                              |
| attributes   | Array    | Array of Strings, keyed by Attribute Name                                                              |

Attributes such as _owner_ and _parent_ return _Objects_. These objects have their own attributes. So, for example, one can get the owner name of a _Component_ by writing:

#### Component Object Example

```bash
set owner = ${_Component_.owner};

echo ${owner.name};
```

or, more simply:

```bash
echo ${_Component_.owner.name};
```

### Component Item

The _Component Item_ object represents a _Component_ item within a _Component_. Access to a _Component_ item is only possible by retrieving the array of _Component_ Item objects from the _Component_ Object.

The following properties can be accessed for a _Component_ item object:

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description**                                                                   |
|--------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ID           | Integer  | _Component_ Item id, as used in the database.                                     |
| name         | String   | _Component_ Item name.                                                            |
| summary      | String   | Summary text.                                                                     |
| parent       | Object   | The _Component_ to which this Item belongs.                                       |
| repository   | String   | The Name of the Repository from which this _Component_ Item pulls files.          |
| target       | String   | The target directory to which the files should be deployed.                       |
| rollup       | Boolean  | Whether this _Component_ Item should be deployed during a roll forward operation. |
| rollback     | Boolean  | Whether this _Component_ Item should be deployed during a roll back operation.    |
| properties   | Array    | An array of Strings representing the values for the Repository Attributes         |

#### Component Item Example

Iterate through the _Component_ items for a _Component_:

```bash
iterate(ci: ${Component.items}) {

echo "name=${ci.name}"; // Component Item Name

echo "repository=${ci.repository}"; // Repository Name

echo "target=${ci.target}"; // Target Directory

echo "rollup=${ci.rollup}"; // rollup (true/false)

echo "rollback=${ci.rollback}"; // rollback (true/false)

set props = ${ci.properties}; // Other Properties

echo "properties:";

foreach(p: $props) { // Properties Specific

echo "$p = ${props[$p]}"; // to the Repository

} // for this Comp Item

}
```

### Credentials

The _Credential  Object_ can be accessed with the built-in getcredential_Function_but only if the user executing the _DMScript_ has read access to it.

If the _Credential_ can be read, then its attributes can be accessed:

The following properties can be accessed for a _Credential Object_:

| Property | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

You can use the _Credential Object_ to access external systems in a secure and controlled manner. The user executing the _DMScript_ must have read access to the _Credential_. However, having read access does not allow the username/password to be viewed or modified using the Web UI. (The username is only displayed for the _Credential_ owner, the username and password can only be changed if the User has update access to the _Credential_).

#### Credential Example

```bash
set db2creds = getcredential("db2cred");

set username = ${db2creds.username};

set password = ${db2creds.password};

// username and password can now be used to access external system

b64authcan be used to generate an authorization string for Basic authentication for web- based APIs. For example:

set webcreds = getcredential("mydomain.webcred");

set auth = ${webcreds.b64auth};

set header = {

"Authorization": "Basic $auth"

};

set res = restful\_get("https://myurl",null,null,$header);
```

NOTE: See the description of restful\_get for more information.

NOTE: If you wish to prevent the credential from being decrypted, then you ensure that the right to create _DMScript_ is only granted to power users. Otherwise, a user could create a _DMScript_ to decrypt a credential to which they only have read access.

### Date Object

The _date object_ represents a date/time in _DMScript_. Dates can be created (with the date() or now()_Functions_) or can be retrieved from a _DropZoneFile_ object (which represents a file in the _DropZone_).

The following methods can be called on the _date object_:

| **Method**    | **Return Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| to\_int(secs) | Integer         | Returns an integer representing the date as the number of seconds since midnight on January 1st 1970 (epoch). The secs parameter is optional. If specified, the specified number of seconds is added to the date/time before the new value is returned. |
| to\_char(fmt) | String          | Formats the date into a string given by the passed fmt string. The fmt string should contain characters as specified below.                                                                                                                             |

### Date Format Characters

The to\_char() method returns a string which is identical to the passed fmt string with the exception of the special character sequences described below. Where these are present in the fmt string, they are replaced with the relevant _Component_ from the date/time as described below:

| **Sequence** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

#### Alternate Format Modifiers

Some conversion specifications can be modified by preceding the conversion specifier character by the E or O modifier to indicate that an alternative format should be used. If the alternative format or specification does not exist for the current locale, the behavior will be as if the unmodified conversion specification were used. (SU) The Single UNIX Specification mentions %Ec, %EC, %Ex, %EX, %Ey, %EY, %Od, %Oe, %OH, %OI, %Om, %OM, %OS, %Ou, %OU, %OV, %Ow, %OW, %Oy, where the effect of the O modifier is to use alternative numeric symbols (say, roman numerals), and that of the E modifier is to use a locale-dependent alternative representation.

NOTE: The date is formatted by to\_char using the C _Function_strftime.

### Domain Object

The _Domain_ object represents a domain in _DMScript_. Domain objects can be retrieved from other objects (such as _Endpoints_, _Environments_, _Applications_ etc). The calling user's home domain can be retrieved via ${me.domain}

The following properties can be accessed on the _Domain_ object:

| **Property**   | **Return Type** | **Description**                                                       |

### Dropzone and DropZone File Object

#### DropZone

The _DropZone Object_ represents a _DropZone_. A _DropZone_ is an area on disk on the DeployHub Pro Server where deployment artifacts are stored and manipulated before onward transmission to the target _Endpoint_(s). A _DropZone_ is placed onto the stack during a using _DropZone_ statement – all operations within this block have access to this _DropZone_ via the _DropZone Object_. A _DropZone Object_ is also present on the stack during pre and post action processing for a _Component_. In this case, the content of the _DropZone_ are the files checked out from the repository for the associated _Component_ Items.

The following properties can be accessed for a _DropZone_ object:

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                    |

| find(pattern) | Array           | Returns an Array of _DropZone Object_, each one of which represents a file in the _DropZone_. The Array is restricted to files whose file name matches the specified pattern. The array is keyed by the full path name of the file. |
| dir()         | String          | The full path of the location on disk where the _DropZone_ is located. Equivalent to the path attribute.                                                                                                                            |

#### DropZone File

The _DropZone File Object_ represents a file in the _DropZone_. It can be retrieved from the _DropZone_ object via the files property or the find method. Both of these calls return an array of _DropZone File Objects_, keyed on the filename. You can also call dir() on a _DropZone File Object_ that represents a zipfile to get an array of _DropZone File Objects_ representing the zipfile content.

The following properties can be accessed for a _DropZone File Object_:

NOTE: See also the description for zipadd, zipget and zipdel.

### Environment Object

The _Environment Object_ represents a deployment target _Environment_. During a deployment, there is always an _Environment  Object_ on the stack representing the current deployment target _Environment_. This can be referenced by $_Environment_. An _Environment Object_ can also be retrieved using the _Get Environment Function_.

The following properties can be accessed for an _Environment_ object:

| **Property**   | **Type** | **Description**                                                               |

|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| getatt(attname)        | String          | Returns the value of the specified attribute held against the _Environment_. Parameter is the attribute name.                                                                                   |
| deptime(_Application_) | Date            | Returns a Date object representing the last time the specified _Application_ was deployed to the _Environment_. Returns null if the specified _Application_ is not currently on the _Endpoint_. |

Note, that attributes such as _owner_ and _parent_ return other _Objects_. These objects have their own attributes. So, for example, one can get the owner name of an _Environment_ by writing:

```bash
set owner = ${_Environment_.owner};

echo ${owner.name};

or, more simply:

echo ${_Environment_.owner.name};
```

Here is an example of retrieving the _Endpoints_ in the _Environment_:

```bash
set servers = ${_Environment_.servers};

iterate(s: $servers) {

echo "server is ${s.name}";

echo "hostname is ${s.hostname}";

}
```

### Endpoint Object

The _Endpoint_ (_server, container, VM/Cloud Image_) object represents where a deployment will be sent. An _Endpoint_ object can be retrieved by accessing the servers array from an _Environment_ or more typically by running a psloop. This iterates through the current _Endpoint_ list, pushing an _Endpoint_ object onto the stack each time through the loop. This _Endpoint_ object can be referenced by $server.

The following properties can be accessed for an _Endpoint_ object:

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description**                                                                          |

| deptime(_Component_)   | Date            | Returns a Date object representing the last time the specified _Component_ was deployed to the _Endpoint_. Returns null if the _Component_ is not currently on the _Endpoint_. |

Note, that the _owner_ attribute returns an _Object_. Such objects have their own attributes.

So, for example, one can get the owner name of an _Endpoint_ by writing:

```bash
set owner = ${server.owner};

echo ${owner.name};

or, more simply:

echo ${server.owner.name};
```

### User Object

The _User object_ represents a user in _DMScript_. _User objects_ can be retrieved as the owner from other objects (such as _Endpoints_, _Environments_, _Applications_ etc.). They can also be returned from a _getuser_ call.

The following properties can be accessed on the User object:

| **Property** | **Return Type** | **Description**                                                                                  |

### UserGroup Object

The _UserGroup object_ represents a UserGroup in _DMScript_. UserGroup objects can be retrieved as the owner from other objects (such as _Endpoints_, _Environments_, _Applications_ etc.). They can also be returned from a getusergroup call or from a _User_ object (as a list of groups to which the user belongs).

The following properties can be accessed on the UserGroup object:

| **Property** | **Return Type** | **Description**                                                                                   |
