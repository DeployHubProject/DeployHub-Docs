## Repositories

A _Repository_ acts as a source location for files that will be deployed as _Component Items_, which are contained in _Components_, to the _Endpoints_ that exist in _Environments_. Each _Component Item_ contains a pointer to where an artifact is stored in a _Repository_ or on a file system. When DeployHub performs the pre-deployment steps, it retrieves the artifact from any location you specify. It pulls it from the _Repository_ and creates a deployment package at deployment run time. For this reason, it does not need to store the actual artifact in the DeployHub versioning engine. Each _Component Item_ is defined with a _Repository_ reference. Your _Repository_ can be any versioning solution such as Git, Subversion and Perforce, or binary repository such as Maven. A _Repository_ can also reference a file system. _Repositories_ can be found under the _Connections_ menu.

## Creating and Deleting a Repository

A _Repository_ is created by clicking on the _Connections_ menu at the top of the DeployHub window, clicking on the Repositories tab on the left side, and right clicking on a _Domain_ in the tree structure. Select &quot;New Repository in this Domain&quot;. Once created, you can click on a _Repository_ in the tree structure to change its characteristics, or right click on it and choose &#39;Delete this Repository&#39; to delete it.

## Editing a Repository

To the right of the tree structure are several tabs which allow you to edit _Repositories_. Keep in mind that once a Type has been chosen and saved for a _Repository_, it cannot be changed to a different Type. The various tabs available for _Repositories_ are listed below, along with the fields contained in each tab, and an explanation for the use and functions of each.

## Properties Tab

The Propertiestab contains a table which is used to define a _Repository&#39;s_ characteristics such as location, search behavior, file type, etc. Properties define the way in which DeployHub will gather information from the _Repository_. Each _Repository_ type has specific Properties and Property values. You add new Properties by selecting the plus (+) in the upper right-hand corner and selecting the Property by choosing it from the Name drop-down list. Properties can be edited by selecting one in the list and clicking the pencil icon or deleted by selecting it and clicking on the X button. Each Property requires a value. All Properties can be defined as _overridable_ or can be encrypted inside the DeployHub database. Some Properties can be also be marked as _appendable_ in which case they can be appended at runtime.

## Component Items and Repositories

_Components_ in DeployHub are made up of one or more _Component Items_. A _Component Item_ is a pointer to a _Repository_ where the artifact is to be extracted. When defining a _Component Item_, the _Repository_ is selected. At this point fields are presented which allow any _Properties_ that have not been defined at the _Repository_ level to be set. If the _Property_ has been defined at the _Repository_ level (as described here) then the _Property_ is not displayed at the _Component Item_ level unless the _Property_ is marked as _overridable_ or _appendable_. In the former case (_overridable_) any value entered for the _Property_ in the _Component Item_ will replace the value set at the _Repository_ level. In the latter case (_appendable_) any value entered for the _Property_ in the _Component Item_ will be appended to the value set at the _Repository_ level.

As you save each of the _Properties_ for a given _Repository_, the table will be populated, and that _Property_ will be removed from the drop-down list in the Properties dialog box. You can only have one entry per _Property_ per _Repository_.

There are different _Properties_ that can be configured for each _Repository_ depending on the _Repository_ Type.

### File System Properties

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _**Name**_ |<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>**Filepath:** This appears in the table by default and is required in order to determine where on the local filesystem the files reside. A Filesystem _Repository_ can only reference files on the filesystem of the Endpoint where DeployHub has been installed.</li><li>**Pattern:** This optional property can be selected as a filter for the files to be pulled from the _Repository_.</li><li>**Recursive:** This optional property can be selected in order to cause the _Repository_ to return all of the files from directories below those designated by Filepath.</li><li>**Version:** Generated by DeployHub when the file is extracted. This is done for all _Repository_ types that do not have a version option.</li></ui> |
| _**Value**_ |<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>**Filepath** : Contains the full pathname to the files. Can be created in a directory below the DeployHub installation directory, allowing the Value field to begin with $DMHOME/ (the base directory of the DeployHub installation).</li><li>**Pattern** : This defines the file types you want to pull from the _Repository_, such as \*.exe, \*.dll, \*.war. For example, a filesystem _Repository_ could be created that has its filepath set to $DMHOME/project1, which contains all of the files for a given project. By setting the pattern field&#39;s value to \*.war, this repository would have as its available files only those that have a suffix of .war, within the project1 directory. If there were numerous file types in the project1 directory, a different _Repository_ could be created that would only contain files with suffixes of .ear by setting the filepath value to the /project1 directory and setting the pattern fields value to \*.ear. By leaving out the pattern property, all of the files located in the _Repository_ will be available. Any and all files coming from a Repository can be further filtered at the _Component_ level.</li><li>NOTE: A single file can also be designated as the only file contained in the Repository by entering the full name of the file, i.e. myWarFile.war.</li><li>**Recursive** : A Checkbox. Clearing this checkbox returns only the files located in the filepath directory. If the checkbox is checked then the search will start at the filepath and locate all files within the filepath directory and all of its sub-directories.</li><li>**Version** : Optional. DeployHub will generate a Version number of &quot;1&quot; for the files extracted if no Version is entered. If a value is entered here then DeployHub will mark all the files as having the specified version number.</li></ul> |
| _**Encrypted**_ | Checkbox that indicates that the value is to be encrypted in the DeployHub database. |
| _**Overridable**_ | Checkbox that indicates the _Property_ can be changed at runtime by specifying a replacement value in the _Component Item_. |
| _**Appendable**_ | Checkbox that indicates the _Property_ can be appended to at runtime by specifying a value to append in the _Component Item_. Note: _Pattern_ and _Recursive_ options cannot be appended. |

Can be created in a directory below the DeployHub installation directory, allowing the Value field to begin with $DMHOME/ (the base directory of the DeployHub installation).</li><li>**Pattern** : This defines the file types you want to pull from the _Repository_, such as \*.exe, \*.dll, \*.war. For example, a filesystem _Repository_ could be created that has its filepath set to $DMHOME/project1, which contains all of the files for a given project. By setting the pattern field&#39;s value to \*.war, this _Repository_ could have as its available files only those that have a suffix of .war, within the project1 directory. If there were numerous file types in the project1 directory, a different _Repository_ could be created that would only contain files with suffixes of .ear by setting the filepath value to the project1 directory and setting the pattern fields value to \*.ear. By leaving out the pattern property, all of the files located in the _Repository_ will be available. These can then be filtered out at the _Component_ level.</li><li>Note: A single file can also be designated as the only file contained in the _Repository_ by entering the full name of the file, i.e. myWarFile.war.</li><li>**Recursive** : A Checkbox.

For example \*.exe, \*.dll, \*.war. For example, a filesystem _Repository_ could be created that has its filepath set to $DMHOME/project1, which contains all of the files for a given project. By setting the pattern field&#39;s value to \*.war, this _Repository_ could have as its available files only those that have a suffix of .war, within the project1 directory. If there were numerous file types in the project1 directory, a different _Repository_ could be created that would only contain files with suffixes of .ear by setting the filepath value to the project1 directory and setting the pattern fields value to \*.ear.

### _**Patterns Tab**_

The Patterns tab contains a table of values that designate which files within the _Repository_ are treated as text files and which are treated as binary files. This is useful for operations such as determining line endings when sending files to Unix or Windows based platforms and performing ASCII-EBCDIC translation when working with iSeries Endpoints. As many rows as necessary can be added to this table in order to allow a _Repository_ to designate files throughout a file system or version control system as text or binary. To add fields to the Pattern table, click on the plus (+) sign in the upper right-hand corner of the window. There are three fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _**Path**_ | This is the directory path where designated files reside. |
| _**Pattern**_ | This field can contain a file designation using regular expressions such as \*.txt, or a single file name, i.e. myfile.war that determines which files within the accompanying Path value are designated as text or binary. The regular expressions that are used here depend on the type of _Repository_. Some use more complex file patterns for designating files than others. |
| _**Text**_ | If this checkbox is checked, all files located in the _Repository_ determined by the Path and Pattern values will be treated as text. All other files are treated as binary. For example, a row in the table can be entered such as:/myFiles/dir1 for the Path and \*.com as the Pattern with the Text box unchecked. This means that all the files within /dir1 with an extension of .com are binary.
Another example would be:/myFiles/dir1/dir2/dir3 for the path and \*.\* as the Pattern, with the Text box checked. This means that all files within /dir3 are text files.
Leaving a Pattern blank is the same as entering \*.\*. In the above examples, if /dir3 also contained .war files, they would also be treated as text files, so this problem would be solved by entering another row in the table that has: /myFiles/dir1/dir2/dir3 as the Path and \*.war as the Pattern, with the Text box unchecked. This tells DeployHub to treat all files in dir3 with the .war extension as binary, and treat all others as text.
Keep in mind that the file designation used in Pattern must be able to be interpreted by the type of _Repository_. Some will accept complex regular expressions, while others will only use a simpler subset, such as those seen in the examples above. |

### _**Recursive Property**_

Adding the recursive Property to a _Repository_ causes all files (and the folders containing them) from beneath the designated filepath to be included as part of the _Repository&#39;s_ contents. Checking the Override checkbox for the filepath property also causes a recursive checkbox to appear for any _Component __Item_ that the _Repository_ is assigned to. When editing a _Component__ Item_, a recursive checkbox appears if a _Repository_ has been assigned to it that contains a recursive _Property_ with its Override checkbox checked. This allows the recursive choice to be made at the _Component __Item_ level. Activate the Recursive Property by checking the Recursive checkbox on the _Component__ Item_. By leaving it unchecked, it is inactive. Leaving Override unchecked in the _Repository_ causes any _Component __Items_ that have been assigned it to be recursive, and the recursive checkbox won&#39;t appear for those _Component__ Items_.

### _**Attributes tab**_

Attributes are used to control values that are needed for interfacing with the _Repository_. The Name field holds the name of the value, and the Value field holds the data, which can be either a numeric or text value. It can also be an array of Name/Value pairs. Clicking on the plus sign (+) icon allows the _User_ to enter a new Name and its associated Value. Clicking on the pencil icon allow the _User_ to edit the selected Attribute in the list. Clicking on the &quot;X&quot; in the upper right-hand corner deletes the currently selected line from the table of Name/Value pairs.

_**Access Tab**_

Allows _Users_ within designated _Groups_ to use and/or change the _Repository_ in various ways. To add a _Group_ to one of the access lists, drag and drop the _Group_ from the Available Groups list on the far right into the desired access list. All _Users_ who belong to a _Group_ that appear in one of the access lists will be granted access to the _Repository_ in the following ways:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _**View Access**_ | Allows the _User_ to see the _Repository_. If the _User_ does not belong to a _Group_ in the View Access list, the _Repository_ will not appear in the tree structure. |
| _**Change Access**_ | Allows the _User_ to changes the _Repository&#39;s_ characteristics i.e. Name, Summary, assigned Credential, etc. |
| _**Check-Out Access**_ | Allows _Users_ to check out files from the _Repository_. This is inherited from the _Read Access_ of the parent _Domain_. |
| _**Check-In Access**_ | Allows _Users_ to check in files to the _Repository_. This is inherited from the _Write Access_ of the parent _Domain_. |

### General Tab

The General Tab displays the basic information about the _Repository._ The _Repository_ can be configured by selecting the pencil icon on the right-hand side of the window.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _**Name**_ | The name of the _Repository_. |

Note, the CA-Harvest command line client must be installed on the same Endpoint as the Deployment Engine.</li><li>_perforce_: Standard connector for the Perforce version control system and can exist anywhere on the network, and is used to retrieve files from Perforce. Perforce Client (p4) must be installed on the same Endpoint as the Deployment Engine.</li><li>_svn_: Standard connector for the Subversion version control system and can exist anywhere on the network. Used to retrieve files from Subversion.</li><li>_http_: Standard connector to retrieve data from a URL – can either be a standard web (HTTP) request or a RESTful style call.</li><li>_ftprep_. Standard connector to retrieve data from external FTP Endpoints.</li><li>rtc: Standard connector to retrieve data from Rational Team Concert Version Control.</li></ul> |
| _**Owner**_ | The owner of the _Repository_, whose default value is the creator of the _Repository_. The default owner is the _User_ who created the _Repository_. When editing this field, the Owner Type field is available which includes _Owner_ and _Group_ as choices. Selecting one of these causes the Owner field to display either _Users_ or _Groups_ to choose from. |
| _**Summary**_ | Short text field with a description of the _Repository_. |
| _**Created**_ | Date and time that the _Repository_ was created. |
| _**Modified**_ | The date and time of the last time the _Repository_ was changed (this does not include the contents of the _Repository_, but the properties of the _Repository_ itself). |
| _**Credentials**_ | A DeployHub object containing the username/password combination that allows the checkout of files from the repository. Note: A Credential can be created from the Credentials tab under the Connections menu. |
