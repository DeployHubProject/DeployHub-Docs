## Publishing New _Application Versions_ in Continuous Delivery

You can configure your continuous delivery system to automatically update new _Application_ versions each time a new GitCommit triggers a new _Component_ that your _Application_ consumes. DeployHub is added to the workflow to perform the continuous versioning of new _Components_ and thier consuming _Applications_.
