## Task

Tasks define a life cycle process associated to _Applications_ and _Releases_, deploy Versions, and make calendar request. Task are defined at the _Domain_ level and cannot be overridden by any other object. All Tasks defined to the _Domain_ are available for all _Applications_ and _Releases_. The following Tasks are available:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Approve Version for Move to Next Pipeline State** | Approves the _Application_ or _Release_ version to move it to a specified state in the pipeline (Life Cycle _Subdomain_). This works in conjunction with the Move Version Task (see below). When the Approve Task is defined, the Target _Domain_ has to be specified. When the Approve Task is executed, the selected an _Application_ or _Release_ version can either be Approved or Rejected. Only when an _Application_ or _Release_ version is Approved can it be moved to the specified Life Cycle _Subdomain_. |
| **Move Version to the Next or Previous Pipeline State** | Moves an _Application_ or _Release_ version from one Pipeline state (Life Cycle _Subdomain_) to another. This can be used as a promotion or a demotion of an _Application_ or _Release_ version between Life Cycle states. When the task is defined, the Life Cycle _Subdomain_ has to be specified as part of the task definition. The Approval Task must be accepted for the Move Version to succeed. |
| **Deploy Version to _Environment_** | Deploys an _Application_ or _Release_ version to an _Environment_. The target _Environment_ is selectable via a drop-down list. |
| **Request Calendar Entry for Deployment to an _Environment_** | DeployHub Pro feature. Sends a request from a _User_ to add a time slot to the calendar for a deployment. The request is sent to _Group_ who has the authority to manage a particular _Enviornment's_ Calendar. When the Request Task is defined, it is linked to the task to be requested. When the Request Task is executed, an entry is placed into the "To Do" list of all the _Users_ within the _Group_ with the calendar access. The Request Task can have a Request Notification Template defined which sends out a notification to the appropriate _Groups_.
