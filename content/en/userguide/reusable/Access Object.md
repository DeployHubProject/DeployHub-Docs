## Access Tab

These four types of access are as follows:

| Access | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _**View**_ | If a _User_ doesn't belong to a _User Group_ in the View Access list for the this object, that object will not appear in the tree structure. This keeps unauthorized _Users_ from seeing the object and helps simplify each _User's_ view of the DeployHub system. |
| _**Change**_ | This allows a _User_ who belongs to any _User Group_ in the list to change the attributes of the object as well as to add/remove items from the object. |
| _**Read**_ | Performs no function for the object itself but acts as an _Inherited Permission_ for items created within the object. The exact meaning of 'Read' will depend on the item created within the object. |
| _**Write**_ | Performs no function for the object itself but acts as an _Inherited Permission_ for items created within the object. The exact meaning of 'Write' will depend on the item created within the object. |
