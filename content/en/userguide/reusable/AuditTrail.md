### Audit Trail 

The Audit Trail displays audit entries for any changes or deployments that impact this object. It includes information concerning what was changed in the object including _User_ date and time, and deployments with unique numbers.

For deployment audits, if you select a deployment number, you will be taken to the details of that deployment including:

| Access | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**Log** | The output of the deployment. |
|**Files**| Any files or objects deployed.|
|**Step Duration**| Deployment Steps with time required to execute.|
|**Feedback Loop**| Shows what was updated starting from _Component_.|

You can also Subscribe or Comment to an Audit Entry. 

- Subscribe: The Subscribe in each entry of the list allows you to receive information about the selected deployment.

- Comment: You can add information by clicking on the 'Comment' link within a text entry field. These appear in the History column of your subscriber's home page. There is a field above the list labeled "Say something about this Application" that can have comments placed into it, and files can be attached to the comment as well. Entering text into this field activates the Add Message button. Click on this button to save the comment as a line in the list.  

- Add Files to Comments: Clicking on the fingerprint button next to the Add Message button brings up a file explorer that allows files to be selected and attached to the comment. These attachments can later be retrieved by clicking on the fingerprint icon on the far right of the comment, which opens the line in the list to display the name of the file. Click on the file name in the dropdown list. This download into the default Downloads folder of the computer that hosts the browser used to run DeployHub (not on the location hosting DeployHub). The options are standard in every Windows file download interface, including Open, Always Open this Type of File, and Show in folder. Several other lists appear along the bottom of the browser. A small 'x' on the far-right side at the bottom can be clicked to make them disappear.
