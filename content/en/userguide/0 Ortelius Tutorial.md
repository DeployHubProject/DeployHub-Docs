  Take a Tour of Continuous Security Intelligence
---
To help you understand the need for continuously monitoring your security intelligence, DeployHub has provided a free version with a tutorial for you to explore. This free version is based on the Ortelius.io open-source project incubating at the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation), hosted by DeployHub Team. Explore how the Ortelius _Application_ is configured and walk through basic concepts of Continuous Security Intelligence. 

![Ortelius Hosted by DeployHub Team](/userguide/images/HostedLogo-SignIn.png)

The Ortelius project uses a decoupled microservices architecture serving as a great example of how Continuous Security Intelligence unifies fragmented clues and forensics across _Components_ to expose the _Application_ level security posture. In this tutorial you will see how Ortelius aggregates _Component_ level security to the _Application_ level providing  _Application_ level:
- SBOMs
- real-time vulnerability reports
- compliance reports

You will also see how Ortelius uses a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to organize data across teams. 

## Signing Up and Getting Started

When you [signup for Ortelius](https://www.deployhub.com/deployhub-team-signup/), you are asked for basic information, your UserID/Password, Company and Project names. Your UserID/Password and Company name are unique.  Your Project will be a _Subdomain_ under your Company _Domain_.

Ortelius is accessible through the following url:

[https://console.deployhub.com/dmadminweb/Home](https://console.deployhub.com/dmadminweb/Home)

Login using the UserID and Password you used when you signed up for Ortelius. Check your email for your login information. 

Upon logging into Ortelius, you will be given an option to select your Company Name Domain, or the Open Source Domain. The Open Source Domain is prepopulated with data so you can take a tour.  Select the Open Source Domain to start exploring.

## Explore Domains

_Domains_ serve as the basic structure of organizing Continuous Security Intelligence. Developers use _Domains_ to catalog their _Components_ based on 'solution spaces.' Organizing your software supply chain in this way allows for _Components_ to be easily shared.

_Domains_ are not folders. They serve as a method for creating fully qualified names of Objects within DeployHub to keep things organized.  _Domains_ also manage security and Tasks.  When you assign security options and Tasks at the _Domain_ level, any child _Subdomain_ inherits the value. A child _Subdomain_ can override a parent _Domain_ value. 

You can explore the _GLOBAL.open source_ Domain to learn how Continuous Security Intelligence is organized.  In DeployHub terminology, the _GLOBAL.open source_ Domain has multiple _Subdomains_.

### Take a Tour of _Domains_:

1) From the left hand side menu, select _Domains_ to see the child _Subdomains_. You will see Linux Foundation, NPM, Golang, Maven as a few of the options. Click on Linux Foundation to expand the chart to view further _Subdomains_.

2) You will see the Linux Foundation includes the CDF and OpenSSF as _Subdomains_. Under the CDF, you will see the child _Subdomain_ Ortelius. Select Ortelius to see the _Subdomains_ associated to the Ortelius project. These _Subdomains_ represent different releases of Ortelius.

For More information on Domains see - [Building _Domains_](/userguide/first-steps/2-defining-domains/)

## Explore Components

_Components_ are artifacts, binaries, database SQL, files or any deployable artifact. _Components_ are assigned to _Applications_. This assignment allows for the aggregation of data from the _Components_ to the _Applications_ that consume them, providing unified Software Bill of Materials reports and Application Security Posture reports.  

### Take a Tour of _Components_

<strong>1) View Components</strong>

From the left hand side menu, select "_Components_". Using the filter option, choose _GLOBAL.Open Source.Linux Foundation.CDF.Ortelius_ to view all of the _Components_ consumed by the Ortelius open source project. 

![Ortelius Domain](/userguide/images/OrteliusDomainSelection.jpg)

<p><br></p>

<strong>2) Component Lists </strong>

Notice that the first item in the list is _ms-compitem-crud;main_. "Main" indicates the base version of this _Component_. The subsequent items in the list shows the changes from the "Main" branch.

![Components](/userguide/images/OrteliusComponentMain.jpg)

<p><br></p>

<strong> 3) Historical Comparisons</strong>

Generate a Comparison Report between two _Component_ versions. Checkmark any two versions and select the _Compare_ option from the list menu  to see their differences.

![Compare Components](/userguide/images/componentlist.jpg)

<p><br></p>

<strong> 4) Software Bill of Materials</strong>

View a _Component_ Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Report. When your _Component_ build executes, Ortelius will generate an Software Bill of Material using the tool of your choice. DeployHub then cross references the known vulnerabilities to the packages. The report shows a timestamp to record the point in time the vulnerabilities were found. This is a static view of the known vulnerabilities at build time. 

![Component SBOM](/userguide/images/SBOM-component.jpg)

<p><br></p>

<strong> 5) Sorting Components</strong>

Sort Components by "Completed." "Completed" indicates the _Component_ has been deployed to end users. From the _Component_ list view, click on "Completed" to sort. Select a _Component_ in the completed list to view its Security Posture and current vulnerabilities. DeployHub provides updates to vulnerabilities every 30 minutes. 

![CompletedComponents](/userguide/images/completed.jpg)

<p><br></p>

<strong>6) Component Details</strong>

View the _Components_ details including the OpenSSF Scorecard Results, current known vulnerabilities, and Overall _Component_ Security Posture.

<strong>7) Blast Radius </strong>

View the Blast Radius of a _Component_. The Blast Radius shows you what 'logical' applications are impacted by a vulnerability, anomaly, or update. From the _Component_ detail screen, scroll to the bottom to see the Dependency Map. You will see this map shows the versions of the Ortelius "logical" _Application_ that are using this version of the _Component_.

## Explore Applications

An _Application_ is a collection of _Components_ that make up a complete software solution.  DeployHub manages the Logical _Application_ aggregating _Component_ data up to the application-level. 

### Take a Tour of _Applications_

<strong>1) Application Lists </strong>

From the left hand side menu, select "_Applications"_. If you have completed the above steps, you will still be in the _GLOBAL.Open Source.Linux Foundation.CDF.Ortelius_ Domain. Notice that the first item in the list is _ortelius_ without a assigned Version number. This indicates the main branch of the Ortelius _Application_. Select "Completed" from the list menu options to sort by all versions of Ortelius that have been released. 

![Application List](/userguide/images/app-list.jpg)

<p><br></p>

<strong> 2) Compare Versions </strong>

Generate a Comparison Report between two _Application_ versions. Checkmark any two versions and select the _Compare_ option from the list menu  to see their differences.

![Compare Applications](/userguide/images/app-compare-select.jpg)

<strong>4) Aggregated Software Bill of Materials</strong>

View an aggregated _Application_ Software Bill of Material report. An _Application_ SBOM is a report that shows all of the _Application's_ _Component_ SBOM data, with duplicates removed. When a _Component_ is updated, DeployHub automatically creates a new version of all _Applications_ consuming the _Component_, with a new aggregated SBOM. DeployHub then cross references all of the _Application's_ _Components_ packages with the known vulnerabilities. The report shows a timestamp to record the point in time the vulnerabilities were found. This is a static view of the known vulnerabilities at build time for the _Application_ with SBOM details. If you are required to produce an SBOM for governance purposes, you can provide your consumers with access to the DeployHub platform allowing them to 'self serve' and track your _Application's_ security posture.  

<p><br></p>

![Export SBOM](/userguide/images/exportSBOM.jpg)

## Conclusion

There are many other features of DeployHub that we did not get to cover on this short test drive. However, you should have the basic understanding of the major Objects and concepts needed to get you started. However, you may want to explore how to connect your CI/CD pipeline to automatically connect SBOMs to your pipeline process. See [SPDX, CycloneDX and Syft](/userguide/integrations/spdx-syft-cyclonedx/) on how you can include SBOMs in your CI/CD process. 

Other topics to explore include: 

- [The Internal Deployment Engine](/userguide/profeatures/deployments/) - execute deployments using DeployHub's internal agentless deployment engine
-  connect your [CI/CD pipeline](/userguide/integrations/ci-cd_integrations/) 

We will leave you with how to setup your own _Applications_ and _Components_ to start gathering forensics for Continuous Security Intelligence. See [Getting Started](/userguide/first-steps/), for getting your setup completed.
