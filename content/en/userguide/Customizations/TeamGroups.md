  Modifying the default User and Administrator Groups 
---

## Intro to _Groups_

DeployHub Team has three default Groups - Administrators, Everyone and Users.  Access control to Objects are based on these three high level _Groups_. DeployHub Team allows you to create as many _Users_ as required but only the "Users" "Everyone" and "Administrator" _Groups_ are available. You can modify these _Groups_ as needed to create access controls around Objects. If you need to create custom _Groups_, you will need to upgrade to DeployHub Pro.  See [Creating Pro User _Groups_](/userguide/profeatures/5-pro-groups/) for details on Pro _User_ _Groups_.

## Using the _Group_ List Viewing

You will find _Groups_ under the Setup menu.  Selecting _Groups_ will take you to a list of displaying the Administration _Group_ and _User_ Group.

From the _Groups_ List View, double click on the _Group_ which you would like to view to see all Details.  

## Using the _Group_ Dashboard for Viewing and Editing

The _Group_ Dashboard view displays all information related to a specific _Group_.

### Group Membership

NOTE: DeployHub creates a Group named "Everyone" whenever it is installed, and every User that is created is added to this group and cannot be removed from it.

This section shows a list of all _Users_ who belong to the selected _Group_. Click on the plus '+Add' option to add a _User_ to this _Group_. A new row will be added to the table with a drop down list allowing you to select the _User_ to add to the _Group_. Select "Save" to commit the row to the table. You can delete a _User_ from the _Group_ using the Delete option.
