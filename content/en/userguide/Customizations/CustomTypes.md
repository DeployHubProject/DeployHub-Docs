  Adding Custom Types for _Endpoints_. 
---

## Intro to _Custom Types_

_Custom Types_ or found on the _Endpoint_ Dashboard and the _Component_ Dashboard and are used to map a _Component_ to it's appropriate _Endpoint_.  For example, a default _Endpoint Type_ is "Application Server."  This maps to a _Component_ defined as an "Application Server."   This mapping allows _Endpoints_ in an _Environment_ to be dynamically assigned _Components_ based the _Endpoint Type_.  

_Components_ map to a single _Endpoint_, but an _Endpoint_ can map to multiple types of _Components_. For example, your _Endpoint_ could serve as both your Application Server and Database Server.

You can create your own _Endpoint Types_ for defining this mapping.
