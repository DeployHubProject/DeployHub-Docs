## SaaS Sign-up Process and the Reverse Proxy

When you [Sign-up to use the SaaS](https://www.deployhub.com/register-for-team/?) version, you will be asked for basic information. Your company and project names are unique 'Domain' and 'Project' identifiers. If someone else from your organization signs up, they will need to create another Project Name.

A high level 'Domain' comes after your Project name, for example "Teller." 
An assigned Pipeline will be called "MyPipeline" that includes 'Dev", "Test", and "Production" stages. 
Then you define your Credentials, Repositories, and the Components of your Application.

You can change the name of your Application or reconfigure your Pipeline in any way needed to reflect your own life cycle process.

To begin deploying, you first install a Reverse Proxy inside your firewall. This contacts DeployHub in our SaaS environment to receive deployment requests.

## What is the Reverse Proxy

A Reverse Proxy queries the DeployHub SaaS every minute to determine if a deployment is needed. For SaaS users, it provides a security layer, preventing you from opening a port to the outside world. It uses standard HTTPS request on the Google GKE environment. Nothing from the external Google side of the firewall is pushed to the local DeployHub Reverse Proxy.

Once the Reverse Proxy determines that a deployment is needed, it executes the deployment using all files on the inside of the firewall. The one-way communication initiates the deployment but all work is done local to your network. On completion of the deployment, the logs are pushed back up to the DeployHub SaaS for viewing and audit.
