## Hipchat

HipChat is a web-based chat and instant messaging service. It features one-on-one group chats, topic chats, and chat rooms, as well as cloud based storage of files and images (5 GB per user), and video calling. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as Android and iOS phones. There is a free version as well as a premium version with additional features for a monthly fee. The premium version adds video calling, screen sharing, unlimited file storage, and history retention. The virtual machine version allows HipChat to run inside the corporate firewall.

DeployHub allows for notifications to be sent to a HipChat URL, which can be a Group, Topic, or Room. Notifications are sent after a deployment to inform the recipient(s) of the deployment&#39;s success or failure.

See the _Notifiers_ section for more information.
