## Slack Integration

Slack is a messaging system that allows teams to share information, including files, pictures, and comments. Team conversations are organized into channels, which can be organized by departments, projects, office locations, etc. A public channel can be created that is open to everyone on the team. Private channels are created to allow only individuals who are invited to participate.

Slack provides mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone (currently in beta), as well as web browser client and native desktop clients for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Additional features include:

- Full Drag and Drop allows files to be dragged from the desktop or folders into Slack. Messages can be sent directly to people or groups.

- Pop up messaging lets users know about incoming messages.

- Notifications from other social media systems (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) can appear in Slack channels.

See the section named _Notifiers_ for more information regarding Slack and it&#39;s use in DeployHub.
