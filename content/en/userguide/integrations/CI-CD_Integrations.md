## DeployHub's Continuous Delivery Integration

The DeployHub continuous delivery integration is used to perform both continuous configuration management and continuous deployments across clusters, clouds and physical data centers. It does this by gathering configuration data related to a build, creating new _Component Versions_ and _Application Versions_, and deploying independently deployable _Components_ into specified _Environments_. It also saves the "build" data as part of the configuration information and associates it to the _Component_ and _Application_. 

DeployHub's uses a standard CLI Container to integrate with continuous delivery solutions that execute workflows in containers. If the solution has a more traditional model, a plug-in is required. Following is a list CD tools that DeployHub has performed joint integrations and their corresponding documentation on how each should be implemented:

| CI Tool | DeployHub Plugin | Reference Document |
|---|---|---|
| **Jenkins** | DeployHub Groovy Library | [Jenkins CI Plug-in](https://github.com/jenkinsci/deployhub-plugin) |
| **CircleCI** | DeployHub CircleCI Orb | [DeployHub Orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/deployhub/deployhub-orb)|
| **Google CloudBuild** | DeployHub CLI Container | [DeployHub CLI Docker Container](https://github.com/ortelius/compupdate) |
| **GitLab** | DeployHub CLI Container | [DeployHub CLI Docker Container](https://github.com/ortelius/compupdate) |
| **TeamCity** | DeployHub CLI Container | [DeployHub CLI Docker Container](https://github.com/ortelius/compupdate) |


### Tracking Build Updates

DeployHub's first hook into the continuous delivery process occurs after the build has been completed and the container has been pushed to a container registry. DeployHub can support any container registry. For more details, reference the above table for for each supported solution. 

### Saved Build Data

Build data is saved to the _Component Version_ and displayed on the _Component Version_ Dashboard. In some cases, DeployHub may need to save custom data. This can be done using the _Component_ Attributes and saved as a key/value pair. This custom data is then displayed as Attributes to the _Component Version_ in the Attributes Section.  

The _Component_ Type determines what data is saved.  See [Defining Components](/userguide/publishing-components/2-define-components/) for a complete listing of the Detail data saved for each different _Component_ Type. 

### Continuous Configuration Management and Versioning

Continuous configuration management and versioning is the process of creating new _Application Versions_ based on the detection of build updates. When an update is detected, DeployHub becomes aware of a new _Component Version_ in the continuous delivery workflow. This tells DeployHub that a new _Component Version_ is available, triggering DeployHub to update the dependency relationship maps of all the consuming _Applications_, therefore creating new _Application Versions_.

This continuous configuration step is particularly important in a microservice implementation.  Every time a new microservice is pushed across the pipeline, it impacts the configuration of the "logical" _Application_ that consumes it.  A new microservice _Component_ creates a new _Application Version_.  This is how DeployHub presents the _Application Version_ Dashboard data showing the relationship and difference maps for each cluster to which the microservice _Component_ is deployed.  

### _Component_ Versioning Schema

DeployHub versions _Components_ differently than it does new _Application Versions_.  _Components_ are tied to Git commits, _Applications_ are not.  

The following are the parts of the versioning schema:

| Schema | Description|
|---|---|
|**Base name** | is the static part of the _Component_ Name.  For example: email-service.|
| **Variant** | is a high level place holder for the versions are created within. The Variant can be aligned with a feature or branch. For example: ssl-update.  Variant is not required.|
|**Version**| is the schematic version number or schematic + Git commit.  For example: v1.5.1.0 or v1.5.1-g3d55a2 |

By default, DeployHub uses an advanced format for the versioning schema. It will automatically increment the version number based on last version found. The advanced format is used since DeployHub has the information from Git to provide a complete version schema.  The advanced formatting is:
~~~
 <base name>;<variant>;v<version>-g<git commit>
~~~
 
The version segment is broken down further into:
 
 ~~~
  v<schematic number>-<number of commits>
~~~  

The number of commits provides an auto-increment of the last part of the schema number.  


An example of the full name is:

~~~
 email-service;ssl-update;v1_5_1_145-g3d55a2
~~~

Below is a breakdown of the individual parts of the versioning schema:

| Part | Explanation |
| ---  | --- |
| **email-service** | Base Name that you supply to the DeployHub Plugin for the _Component_. |
| **semi colon** | Separator. |
| **ssl-update** | Variant that you supply to the DeployHub Plugin for the _Component_. |
| **semi colon** | Separator. |
| **v** | Indicates start of the version. |
| **1_5_1**| Version that you supply to the DeployHub Plugin for the _Component_. |
| **145** | Number of Git Commits for the associated repository.  Used for auto incrementing. |
| **-g** | Separator indicating that the Git commit is next. |
| **3d55a2** | Git command SHA for the commit that triggered the CD process. |

Note: The Variant is optional.  That part of the _Component_ name will be left out if the Variant passed to DeployHub by the CD workflow is blank.

### _Application_ Versioning Schema

The DeployHub continuous delivery integration will automatically maintain the _Application Version_ if the _Application_ Name and a starting version identifer are provided. If the _Application_ Name and version identifier are passed to DeployHub a new _Application Version_ will be created using the previous version identifier as a starting point. An _Application Base_ version must exist in order for DeployHub to automatically create a new _Application Version_ when a new _Component Version_ is created. The base version gives DeployHub the starting point to perform automatic _Application_ versioning.

 DeployHub uses a similar naming convention for _Application Versions_ as it does for _Component Versions_:

| Part | Explanation |
| ---  | --- |
|**Base name**| The static part of the _Application_ Name.  For example: webstore.|
|**Variant** | A high level place holder for that versions are created within. The Variant can be aligned with a feature or branch. For example: 50percent-sale.  Variant is not required.|
|**Version**| The schematic version number. For example, 1_2_10.|

DeployHub uses the <base name>;<schematic version number>;<version number> as the default format for the versioning schema.   The formatting is:

~~~
<base name>;<variant>;<schematic version number>;<version number> if a Variant is used. 
~~~

Deploy will automatically increment the version number based on last version found. It will create a new _Application Version_ based on the last _Application Version_ and replace the old _Component Version_ with the new _Component Version_.  The new _Component Version_ will be added if an old verion was not found.

You can use your CI/CD process to include variance in your versioning number (base name, variant, version).  See [Component Versioning Schema](/userguide/integrations/ci-cd_integrations/#_component_-versioning-schema).

### Deploying the _Application Version_

Once the versioning is completed, DeployHub is called to perform the deployment. The _Application Version_ and _Environment_ are required for the deployment. The deployment number will be returned to both DeployHub and the continuous delivery solution to be displayed in the output.

## Lifecycle Tasks and Continuous Delivery Workflows

You can incorporate DeployHub's Lifecycle _Subdomain_ Tasks as follows:  

**Move**

DeployHub will move the _Application_ from one Lifecycle _Subdomain_ to another using the DeployHub _Move Task_.  This enables the _Application_ to move through the same pipeline steps that the CD process is using.

**Approve**

If you are using DeployHub Pro, you can incorporate Approvals into your process. DeployHub will perform an Approval of an _Application_ Move.  This _Approve_ feature is used to reflect an approval that was done in the CD Pipeline for an _Application's_ audit trail.  

For documentation on incorporating Tasks, refer to your specific CD tool documentation as listed above.
