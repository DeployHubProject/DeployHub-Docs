  Tracking Change Request with DeployHub Pro.
---

If you are using DeployHub Pro, you can configure _Components_ with  _Change Requests_. To do this, you will need to define a connection to the change request system. This can be done using _Data Sources_.

Once your _Data Source_ has been defined, it will show as an option when defining your _Component_ in the _Change Request_ data field.  Once connected and assigned to the _Component_, anytime a _Change Request_ has been opened against the _Component_ it will be tracked and displayed as part of the _Application_ Last Deployment Difference Map and will be available in the Change Request Section of both _Applications_ and _Components_.

For more information on configuring Jira, Bugzilla or Git as a _Data Source_, go to:
[Managing Data Sources](/userguide/customizations/2-data-sources/)
