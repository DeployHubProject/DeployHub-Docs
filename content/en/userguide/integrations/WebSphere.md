  Executing deployments requiring a WebSphere Server.

![Websphere](/userguide/images/websphere.png)

A DeployHub Pro deployment can point to one or more _Repositories_ which contain the artifacts (.ear, .jar, and .war files) that make up a WebSphere application. These are referenced in DeployHub Pro by one or more _Components_ (and one or more of their _Component__Items_) within an _Application_. A _Post Action_ is then executed which deploys these artifacts into WebSphere. The user creates the _Action_, which itself contains _Procedures_. The Procedure defined to the _Action_ for a WebSphere deployment is called "WebSphereDeploy."

## Creating the WebSphere Action

## New Action for the WebSphere

Once you have imported your _Procedures_, you can define your _Action_. Change to the _Actions_ list view and select "Add" menu.  

Name the new Action "WebSphereDeployAction" (no spaces).

Now we are going to customize this Action. You will see the 'Activity Hub' on the righthand side of your screen. Navigate to your Domain to find the Procedures. Drag them onto the area under _Start._

At this point the Action is ready to be used by anyone with access (based on Domain and security options). Each Component that uses the Action will need to define specific values.
The _Action_ can now be placed into the _Post Action field_ of a _Component_ as part of an _Application_ deployed to a WebSphere region.
