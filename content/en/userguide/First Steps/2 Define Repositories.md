  How to Connect Repositories to retrieve artifacts. 
---

## Intro to Repositories

A _Repository_ is used by a _Component_. A _Repository_ acts as a source location for artifacts that will be deployed as _Components_. Each _Component_ contains a pointer to where an artifact is stored in a _Repository_ or on a file system. When DeployHub performs the pre-deployment steps, it retrieves the artifact from any location you specify. It pulls it from the _Repository_ and creates a deployment package at deployment run time. For this reason, it does not need to store the actual artifact in the DeployHub versioning engine. Each _Component_ is defined with a _Repository_ reference. Your _Repository_ can point to any type of repository such  as Git, GitHub, Quay or binary repository such as Maven. A _Repository_ can also reference a file system.

## Container Repositories

You do not need to define a _Repository_ if you only deploy containers. Containers are managed in "registries" which are handled differently than source code and file repositories. If you use a Container registry, DeployHub references this from within your Container _Component_ definition.  When you define your _Component_ as a "Container" _Component_ Type, you will enter the following container details:  

- container registry
- container image
- container digest
- container tag  

## Use the Repository List View for Adding and Deleting

The _Repository_ menu option is in the **Setup** menu on the left of the DeployHub main panel. Select the _Repository_ menu for a list of all _Repositories_ to which you have access. The Search bar, represented by a funnel icon, filters _Repositories_ based on Name or Domain.

The _Repository_ List View has the following Tabs:

| Tab | Description |
| --- | --- |
|Refresh | Refreshes the browser. |
| Add | Allows you to Add a new _Repository_. Select from various pre-configured _Repository_ Types. Each Type will determine the Details for that _Repository_.|
| Delete | Deletes the selected item. |

Double click on an item in the list to get the _Dashboard_ view.

## Use the Repository Dashboard for Viewing and Editing

The Dashboard view displays all information related to a specific _Repository_ Type.  Following are the Repository Types supported out-of-the-box:

- HTTP
- File System (included as a default with override and append options enabled)
- OpenMake Meister (Build system with a binary repository)
- SVN

### Common Details of all _Repositories_ Types

|**Endpoint Encrypted** | Select the box to indicate the Endpoint should be hidden in the database.|
|**Endpoint Override** |Select the box if the Endpoint can be replaced at the _Component_ definition.|
|**Version** | Value optional. DeployHub will generate a Version number for the files extracted if no Version is entered. |
|**Version Encrypted** | Select the box to indicate the Version should be hidden in the database.|
|**Version Override** |Select the box if the Version can be replaced at the _Component_ definition.|

## File System _Repository_ Details

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Filepath**|  The fully qualified directory name to the files that will need to be deployed. These files must be on a file system that the DeployHub deployment engine has access to. |

|**Recursive**| Select the box in order to cause the _Repository_ to return all of the files from directories below those designated by Filepath. |
|**Recursive Override** |Select the box if the Recursive option can be replaced at the _Component_ definition.|
|**Version**| Allows for the auto generation of a version number based on a template that you define. Enter the template with variables, such as V${buildnumber} to create your unique version number upon deployment. This is most commonly used with DMScript. |

## Repository Access Controls

The Access Section allows _Users_ within designated _Groups_ to update the _Repository_. To add a _Group_ to one of the access lists, drag and drop the _Group_ from the Available Groups list onto desired access list. All _Users_ who belong to a _Group_ that appear in one of the Access lists will be granted access to the _Repository_ in the following ways:

| Access | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **View** | If a _User_ belongs to a _UserGroup_ in the View Access list for the this _Repository_, the _Repository_ will be visible. |
| **Change** | This allows a _User_ who belongs to any _UserGroup_ in the list to change the attributes of the _Repository_. |
| **Check-out Access** | Allows Users to check out files from the _Repository_. This is inherited from the Read Access of the parent _Domain_. |
| **Check-in Access** | Allows Users to check in files to the _Repository_. This is inherited from the Write Access of the parent _Domain_. |
