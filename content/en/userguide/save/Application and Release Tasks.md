| **Request Calendar Entry for Deployment to an _Environment_** | DeployHub Pro feature. Sends a request from a _User_ to add a time slot to the calendar for a deployment. The request is sent to _Group_ who has the authority to manage a particular _Environment's_ Calendar. When the Request Task is defined, it is linked to the task to be requested. When the Request Task is executed, an entry is placed into the "To Do" list of all the _Users_ within the _Group_ with the calendar access. The Request Task can have a Request Notification Template defined which sends out a notification to the appropriate _Groups_.
