### Database Specific Data Definition

Database _Components_ are used for making database updates such as table changes using SQL Scripts. Note: An database form (such as an Oracle Form) can be compiled and should be defined as an Application File not Database _Component_.

| **Base Directory**                | Base, or high level, directory where the file will be deployed. This value will be ignored if the _Endpoint_ has a Base Directory defined.

| **Roll Forward Repository**       | Choose the Repository that contains your Roll Forward SQL. This list box is populated based on the _Repositories_ pre-defined in your initial setup. Based on the _Repository_ you select, you may be provided override or append fields if they were made available. For more information on _Repositories_ see [Connecting Your Repositories](/first-steps/2-define-repositories/#using-the-repository-dashboard-for-viewing-and-editing).<ul><li>Filepath Override: Enter a filepath that will override the default filepath defined at the _Repository_ level.</li><li>Pattern Override: Enter a pattern that will override the default pattern defined at the _Repository_ level.  Patterns are file types you want to pull from the _Repository_, such as \*.exe, \*.dll, \*.war. </li><li>Recursive Override: Select the box in order to override the default recursive behavior defined at the _Repository_ level.

### Formatting of the Deployment Directory with Base and Target Directories for Database and Application File Deployments

You must define the directory where your _Component_ file is going to be deployed on your _Endpoint_.  This is the purpose of your _Component_ Base and Target Directories. The Base Directory is the high level directory, the Target Directory is the lower level, or final "Target" directory.  _Endpoints_ may be managed by a System Administrator who may want to force the use of a particular Base Directory on the _Endpoint_.  If so, this directory can be set at the _Endpoint_ Base Directory and override the _Component_ level Base Directory.  When a deployment occurs, the process will check to see if the _Endpoint_ has a Base Directory defined, and will replace the _Component_ Base Directory with the _Endpoint_ Base Directory to create the full path for the deployment.

Below is how the full file deployment path is formatted:

| Component Base Directory Value | Component Target Directory Value | Endpoint Base Directory Value | Result                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Has Value                      | Null                             | Null                          | The files will be placed in the _Component_ Base Directory.                            |
| Null                           | Has Value                        | Null                          | The files will be placed in the _Component_ Target Directory.                          |
| Null                           | Null                             | Has Value                     | The files will be placed in the _Endpoint_ Base Directory.                             |
| Null                           | Has Value                        | Has Value                     | The files will be placed in the Endpoint Base Directory + Component Target Directory.  |
| Has Value                      | Null                             | Has Value                     | The files will be placed in the _Endpoint_ Base Directory.                             |
| Has Value                      | Has Value                        | Null                          | The files will be placed in the Component Base Directory + Component Target Directory. |
| Has Value                      | Has Value                        | Has Value                     | Endpoint Base Directory + Component Target Directory.                                  |
| Null                           | Null                             | Null                          | Deployment will fail.                                                                  |
