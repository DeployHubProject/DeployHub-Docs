## Intro to _Environments_

A DeployHub _Environment_ is a collection of [_Endpoints_](/userguide/2-define-endpoints/). _Environments_ represent where you run your _Application_ or where your _Application_ is published. _Environments_ often represent where development, test, or production code is running. An _Environment_ could be a virtual cloud or artifact repository. Therefore, there is a many-to-many relationship between _Environments_ and _Endpoints_, so that an _Endpoint_ can be assigned to more than one _Environment_, and an _Environment_ can contain many _Endpoints_. 

This data establishes relationships that allow for mapping a vulnerability found at the _Component_ level to the specific _Environment_ and _Endpoint_ where it is running.
 
>Note: Because _Endpoints_ are assigned to _Environments_, _Endpoints_ must be created first. 

## Adding _Environments_ Via Your CI/CD Workflow

The Ortelius open-source project Command Line Integration (CLI) automates the creation of _Environments_. When a deployment is logged, the CLI is passed the _Application Version_, _Environment_, and _Endpoints_. The CLI will automatically create _Endpoints_ and _Environments_ if they do not already exist. If no _Endpoint_ is provided to the CLI, the name of the _Endpoint_ will default to the _Environment_ name. At least one _Environment_ name must be passed to the CLI. To learn more, read the chapter  [CI/CD and DeployHub](/userguide/integrations/ci-cd_integrations/)

You can also add _Environments_ manually via the Dashboard.


### _Environments_ and _Domains_

_Environments_ are associated to a [_Domain_](/userguide/2-defining-domains/). You can assign _Environments_ to any level of _Domain_. However, _Environments_ are most commonly associated to a _Project Domain_ used for _Applications_. 

## Use the List View to Add and Delete _Environment_ 

The _Environment_ menu is on the left of the main panel. Select the _Environment_ menu, to view a list of all _Environments_ to which you have access. The Search bar, represented by a funnel icon, allows you to reorder _Environments_ based on Name or _Domain_.

The _Environments_ List View has the following Tabs.

| Tab         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Refresh** | Refreshes the browser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Add**     | Allows you to Add a new _Environment_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Delete**  | Deletes the selected item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Reports** | Success or Failed Report:  This report shows an ongoing list of all deployments to all _Environments_, regardless of _Domain_ or _Application_ with success or fail status. This report can be sorted based on the column for easy viewing. It can also be exported. |

Double click on an item in the list to see the _Dashboard_ view.

## Use the _Environment_ Dashboard to View and Edit

The Dashboard view displays all information related to a specific _Environment_. The Dashboard view has one additional tab option - Calendars. Below are the Details for an _Environment_.

### _Environment_ Details

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**Full _Domain_**| The fully qualified name of the _Domain_, including all parent _Domains_. This is a required field. 
| **Name**| The name of the _Environment_. Note: Duplicate Names are restricted. It is recommended that _Environments_ be named in a specific manner, such as 'DevEnv-Ortelius.' This is a required field |
|**Owner Type**| User or Group |
| **Owner**| The owner defaults to the _User_ or _Group_ who created it.  |
|**Summary**| A short text description of the _Environment_. |
|**Availability**| This field interacts with the _Environment_ calendar making the _Environment_ open for deployments at anytime, or closed for all deployments unless scheduled. The default value, "Always Available Unless Denied by Calendar", allows the _User_ to deploy _Applications_ into the _Environment_ unless there is an entry in the Calendar that prevents stops it. The other value, "Always Unavailable Unless Denied by Calendar", doesn't allow deployments unless a specific entry in the Calendar is approved. |
| **Created** | Auto generated date and time the _Environment_ was created. |
| **Modified** | Auto generated date and time the _Environment_ was last modified. |

### _Endpoint_ Access Control

The Access Section allows _Users_ within designated _Groups_ to update the _Environment_. To add a _Group_ to one of the access lists, drag and drop the _Group_ from the Available Groups list onto desired access list. All _Users_ who belong to a _Group_ that appear in one of the Access lists will be granted access to the _Environment_ in the following ways:

| Access                      | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **View**                    | Allows the _User_ to see the _Environment_. If the _User_ does not belong to a _Group_ in the View Access list, the _Environment_ will not appear in the List View. |
| **Change**                  | Allows the _User_ to change the _Environment's_ characteristics i.e. Name, Summary, etc.                                                                            |
| **Create Calendar Entries** | Allows _Users_ to control the Calendar for the selected _Environment_.                  |
| **Deploy**                  | Allows _Users_ to deploy  _Applications_ into the selected _Environment_.                                                                                           |

### Assigned _Endpoints_

Note: You will need to have pre-defined your _Endpoints_.  See the [Define Your Endpoints](/userguide/2-define-endpoints/) chapter for more information.

_Environments_ are a collection of _Endpoints_. Use this section to assign the _Endpoints_ that will make up this _Environment_. Use +Add to create a new row in the _Endpoints_ table. Use Save to commit the row.  Select the row and use Edit or Delete to update or remove an _Endpoint_. When you add a new _Endpoint_ the  Hostname will be displayed. The Hostname is the actual network name or IP address.  It is assigned when the _Endpoint_ is defined, but is not a required field. If it is defined, it will be displayed in the row.


### Assigned _Applications_

View all the _Application Base Versions_ assigned to this _Environment_. This is read only.  _Applications Base Versions_ are associated to _Environments_ when created using the [_Application_ Dashboard](/userguide/2-defining-applications/#viewing-and-editing-with-the-_application_-dashboard).

### Deployed _Components_ to _Environment_ Map

This map shows you all of the current _Component Versions_, with _Application Versions_, that have been deployed to this _Environment_.

## Environment Calendar 

DeployHub users have access to "Smart" Calendars.  For more information see [DeployHub Smart Calendars](/userguide/advanced-features/deployments/calendar/).
